Virtual Assistant is an application that you can chat with and that can give you advice, jokes, quotes or lyrics.

It can also perform tasks such as setting alarms, setting timers, converting units of measure and currencies, finding the meaning of words in a dictionary, finding a location on a map, finding news, providing weather information, opening a web page, and initiating actions such as adding a new contact, the Internet search, navigate, email or text, or make a phone call.

You can communicate with the assistant via voice or text, and it supports multiple languages.

It can also recognize objects and text in the images you upload.
